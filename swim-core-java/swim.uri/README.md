**swim-uri** provides a rich object model for working with Uniform Resource
Identifiers, URI subcomponents, and URI patterns, including an efficient and
safe codec for parsing and writing compliant URI strings.  Rich APIs for paths
and queries simplify deconstruction and manipulation of parsed URI objects.
**swim-uri** is part of the [**Swim Core**](https://github.com/swimos/swim/tree/master/swim-system-java/swim-core-java) framework.
